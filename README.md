## 📊 Project Overview

This project delivers a production-ready machine learning system that:

- **Predicts** customer churn with 84-86% AUC accuracy
- **Calculates** Customer Lifetime Value to prioritize high-value customers
- **Compares** three ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- **Provides** actionable insights through an interactive web application

### Key Features

✅ **Interactive Prediction Tool** - Input customer data and get real-time churn predictions  
✅ **Model Comparison Dashboard** - Compare performance across multiple algorithms  
✅ **CLV Analysis** - Understand revenue at risk by customer segment  
✅ **Business Insights** - Actionable recommendations for retention strategies

## 🏗️ Business Context & Methodology

### Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Calculation

**Formula**: CLV = Monthly Charges × Expected Tenure

**Key Assumptions**:
- **Expected Tenure**: 24 months for all customers
- **Rationale**: Industry average for telecom services, balances optimism with realism
- **No Discount Rate**: Simplified model focusing on gross revenue impact

### CLV Segmentation Strategy

| Segment | CLV Range | Retention Priority | Strategy |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|----------|
| **Premium** | $3,000+ | 🔴 Critical | White-glove service, dedicated support |
| **High** | $2,000-3,000 | 🟡 Important | Contract incentives, loyalty rewards |
| **Medium** | $1,000-2,000 | 🟢 Standard | Feature education, usage optimization |
| **Low** | <$1,000 | 🔵 Basic | Value demonstration, basic retention |

## 🤖 Model Performance

| Model | Precision | Recall | F1 | AUC |
|-------|-----------|--------|----|----|
| **Logistic Regression** | 0.82 | 0.65 | 0.72 | 0.81 |
| **Random Forest** | 0.85 | 0.68 | 0.75 | 0.84 |
| **XGBoost** | 0.87 | 0.72 | 0.79 | **0.86** |

### Model Selection Rationale

- **XGBoost** selected as primary model (highest AUC: 0.86)
- **Ensemble approach** averages all three models for final prediction
- **Recall target** of 60%+ achieved (72% with XGBoost)
- **High-risk validation**: Senior citizen + month-to-month + fiber optic customers correctly identified as >60% churn probability

## 📈 Key Business Insights

### 🎯 High-Value Customer Risk
- **Premium CLV customers** have the highest total revenue at risk
- Despite being valuable, they don't necessarily churn less frequently
- **Recommendation**: Implement dedicated retention team for Premium segment

### 💰 Revenue at Risk Analysis
- **Total revenue at risk**: $2.4M across all segments
- **Average risk per churning customer**: $1,847
- **ROI threshold**: Justify retention spend up to $369 per customer (20% of CLV)

### 🚨 Critical Risk Factors
1. **Month-to-month contracts** (+30% churn risk)
2. **Low tenure** (<12 months) (+25% churn risk)  
3. **Electronic check payment** (+20% churn risk)
4. **Senior citizens** (+15% churn risk)
5. **Fiber optic without tech support** (+15% churn risk)

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Data Pipeline
- **Source**: IBM Telco Customer Churn dataset (7,043 customers)
- **Split**: 60% train / 20% validation / 20% test (stratified)
- **Features**: 20+ engineered features including tenure buckets, service counts, and interaction flags

### Feature Engineering
```python
# Key engineered features
- tenure_bucket: Categorical tenure ranges (0-6m, 6-12m, etc.)
- services_count: Total number of active services
- monthly_to_total_ratio: Spending consistency metric
- service_flags: Interaction features (e.g., "fiber_no_security")
```

### Model Architecture
- **Preprocessing**: StandardScaler for Logistic Regression, none for tree-based models
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: GridSearchCV with validation set
- **Class Imbalance**: Handled via `class_weight='balanced'` and `scale_pos_weight`
- **Ensemble**: Simple average of all three model predictions

### Deployment
- **Platform**: Streamlit Community Cloud
- **Performance**: <2 seconds per prediction
- **Caching**: Aggressive caching of models and data using `@st.cache_resource`
