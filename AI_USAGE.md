- **Performance Optimization**: Measured and optimized prediction response times

## üöÄ Prompting Strategies That Worked

### 1. Specific Context Setting
**Effective**: "Create a churn prediction system for SaaS companies that needs to identify high-value customers at risk"
**Why**: Provided business context that shaped technical decisions

### 2. Incremental Development
**Effective**: "First create the data prep script, then we'll build the modeling pipeline"  
**Why**: Allowed for validation and iteration at each step

### 3. Performance Requirements
**Effective**: "The Streamlit app needs to load in <2 seconds and handle 100+ predictions per minute"
**Why**: Set clear technical constraints that guided architecture decisions

### 4. Business Validation
**Effective**: "Test that senior citizens with month-to-month contracts get >60% churn probability"
**Why**: Ensured model outputs align with business expectations

## ‚ùå What Didn't Work Well

### 1. Generic Code Generation
**Issue**: Initial prompts for "create a machine learning model" produced overly generic code
**Solution**: Added specific business requirements and performance targets

### 2. Complex Visualizations
**Issue**: AI-generated plots sometimes had unclear labels or poor formatting
**Solution**: Manually refined visualizations for professional presentation

### 3. Deployment Configuration
**Issue**: AI suggestions for Streamlit Cloud deployment missed some nuances
